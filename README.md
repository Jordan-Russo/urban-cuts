A friendly and attractive contemporary website for a local barbershop where locals can get the sharpest cuts!

## Optimizations

One of the major features I would add is the ability to schedule appointments. 
This could be achieved by linking it directly using Google APIs that handle these tasks. 
In addition, integration of Google APIs would enable me to include reviews from customers and their ratings on the site.

## Lessons Learned:
<ul>
  <li>Integrating Google Maps into a business website isn't as demanding as I initially thought. </li>
  <li>In a world that is dominated by phones, having a responsive website makes all the difference because it allows everyone to view the site, regardless of viewport dimensions.</li>
  <li>Media queries are one tool to reach this but using fluidity with percentages and grid systems (flex/grid) is paramount for good modern design.</li>
</ul>
